The classification is based off the data gathered from Cheese.com .
It evaluates what cheese the user is trying to get based of off 9 different attributes
Each cheese may posess different attributes OR may be missing attributes,
the system accounts for this by awarding each cheese an accuracy value based off of their attributes and what the user enters.
A cheese in the real world may have one of many values for a particular value
For example
Cheese A can be either pasturized or un pasturized 
So cheese A's values for pasturized in the system will be: yes, no
so if a user enters a value for pasturized once it is included in the cheese's values it will be awarded.

Another example
Cheese B can be made in Italy, France or Germany
Once a user enters one of these values Cheese B will be awarded accuracy values

Missing data
The system allows a user to enter 'unknown' for an attribute they do not know
in which case no cheese would be awarded any accuracy values
E.G. 
You dont know if the cheese is Pasturizeed or not you can enter unknown
